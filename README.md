Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

   I downloaded Windows 11 from the provided link and followed the installation instructions to set it up on my system.

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

After downloading Visual Studio Code, I launched the installer and chose my preferred installation directory.
During installation, I opted to add Visual Studio Code to the system PATH to enable command-line access.
Once installed, I launched Visual Studio Code and personalized it by adjusting settings like themes, font size, and keyboard shortcuts.
Exploring the Extensions view, I installed extensions relevant to my workflow, such as those for Python development, Git integration, and code formatting.

3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

   I downloaded the Git installer from the official website and executed it.
During installation, I selected options such as adding Git to the system PATH and choosing the default text editor.
Next, I opened a command prompt or terminal and configured Git with my name and email address using the git config command.
Visiting GitHub's website, I created an account and generated an SSH key pair, adding the public key to my GitHub account settings.
In my project directory, I initialized a Git repository with git init, added files with git add ., committed changes with git commit, and linked the local repository to a remote GitHub repository with git remote add origin <repository-url>.

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

After downloading the Python installer, I ran it and selected the option to add Python to the system PATH, because it didn't show on cmd.
Throughout the installation, I ensured to select additional components like pip, which is the package installer for Python.
To verify the installation, I opened a command prompt or terminal and ran python --version.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

   I install pip and executed pip install. To confirm its presence, I executed pip --version in the command prompt or terminal.

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

   Upon downloading the MySQL installer, I ran it and selected the desired installation type (e.g., Developer Default).
Throughout the installation process, I configured options such as the MySQL root password and used the default port number.
After installation, I launched the MySQL Command Line Client to ensure that the database server was running and to perform initial configurations as needed.


7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

If opting for Docker, I visited the Docker website, downloaded the Docker Desktop installer, and executed it.
Throughout installation, I made selections such as enabling Hyper-V and WSL 2 if required by my system.
Once Docker was installed, I started the Docker Desktop application and verified its functionality by running a sample container.
For virtual machines, I selected a virtualization software like VirtualBox or VMware, downloaded the installer, and followed the installation instructions.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

Opening Visual Studio Code, I navigated to the Extensions view and explored available extensions through the Marketplace tab.
I installed extensions relevant to my workflow, such as those for syntax highlighting, linting, debugging, and integration with version control systems like Git, python, dart and prettier.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. Operating System (OS):



#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.
